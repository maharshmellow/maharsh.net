## Overview

Inhale is an open source Guided Breathing application for iOS that was made to learn SwiftUI and iOS Development. It guides the user through a common [box-breathing](https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing) pattern which consists of a 4 second inhale, 7 second hold, followed by a 8 second exhale. Following such a pattern has been proven to help increase focus, decrease stress, as well as aid with sleep.

## Features
#### Custom Breathing Pattern
While the 4-7-8 pattern is common, there are many variations that can also be practiced. To help with this, Inhale allows the user to select the time for each stage of the exercise. 

#### Haptic Feedback
Since most users prefer to meditate with their eyes closed, Inhale also has vibrations/haptic feedback to guide users not looking at the screen. 

#### Apple Health Integration 
When using Inhale, all the time spent doing breathing exercises can be automatically logged to Apple Health as mindful minutes.
